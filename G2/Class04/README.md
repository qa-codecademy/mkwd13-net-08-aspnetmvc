## Views in ASP.NET

Views in ASP.NET are responsible for the application's data presentation and user interaction. They are HTML templates with embedded Razor markup. In ASP.NET Core MVC, views are `.cshtml` files that use the C# programming language in Razor markup. Usually, view files are grouped into folders named for each of the app's controllers.

## Types of Views in ASP.NET

There are three types of views in ASP.NET:

1. **Regular Views**: These are the standard views that display the application's user interface.
2. **Partial Views**: These reduce code duplication by managing reusable parts of views. For example, a partial view is useful for an author biography on a blog website that appears in several views.
3. **Layout Views**: These provide consistent webpage sections and reduce code repetition. Layouts often contain the header, navigation and menu elements, and the footer.

## Razor Engine

The Razor Engine is a key component of ASP.NET Core‚Å∂. It provides a powerful and efficient way of generating HTML content dynamically‚Å∂. The Razor Engine also offers a way to embed server-based code into web pages using an HTML-like template syntax‚Å∂.

## Razor Syntax Examples

Razor syntax supports C# and uses the `@` symbol to transition from HTML to C#¬π. Here are some examples:

- Single statement block:
    ```csharp
    @{
        var myMessage = "Hello World";
    }
    ```
- Inline expression or variable:
    ```csharp
    <p>The value of myMessage is: @myMessage </p>
    ```
- Multi-statement block:
    ```csharp
    @{
        var greeting = "Welcome to our site!";
        var weekDay = DateTime.Now.DayOfWeek;
        var greetingMessage = greeting + " Here in Huston it is: " + weekDay;
    }
    <p>The greeting is: @greetingMessage </p>
    ```
